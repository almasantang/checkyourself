            bullying is the lowest form of human behaviour to show dominance over someone vulnerable.
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
            Bullying sucks.
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
            It is an act of discrimination, intimidation, and violence.
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
            bullying is useless.
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
            It is Making people feel shit for no good reason other than to belittle them.
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
            Bullying is not having the awareness or worse having the awareness of "the line" between banter and cruelty.
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
            It is a reflection of some sort of insecurities.
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
            Bullying is an immature exercise of power.
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
            Bullying is hurting someone’s feelings on purpose.
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
            Bullying is harassment of an individual that can come through in many forms; physical, psychological, cyber, emotional etc.
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
            being bullied is being rejected, discriminated, humiliated.
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
            I believe that if you bully someone then you implicitly state, at that moment, that their life and they themselves, have lesser value as a human being than you do.

          Bullying is when you repeatedly, and intentionally use words or actions against someone (or a group of people) to cause distress and make them feel helpless and feel bad about themselves.
          <br><br>
          It happens everywhere, from playground to workplace.
          <br>
          It affects everyone involved; the perpetrator, victim and those who witness it. With serious and long-term emotional consequences adding to the immediate harmful effects, communities that condone or ignore bullying may create an environment fostering more serious anti-social behaviour.
