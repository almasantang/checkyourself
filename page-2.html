            It made me feel powerless.
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
            It made me feel angry but I couldn't express it to others.
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
            I felt terrible
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
            It made me feel really angry.

            Hurt.
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
            Made me feel unworthy and bitter.
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
            don't be a bully.
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
            The thing that gets me annoyed is when it isn't a fair scenario when multiple people are having a shot at one person.
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
            Bullying made me feel insecure, discouraged, scared.
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
            I feel threatened.
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
            It made me feel conscious about myself and lowered my self esteem.

  <p class="message">I was bullied since 6th grade to junior high school; it made me felt insecure and degraded. There was even a point where it made me emotional and did violence due to my anger issues of being bullied. My friends hated me because I was a transferred student and thought I was acting 'cool' in purpose. Also, because the boys were hanging out with me (not amorous) yet they feel annoyed as they can not be that close to them. At these times, I go to school with my head down.</p>

  <p class="message">Back in elementary school, there were these teachers who treated me like I would never fit their expectations. Like all I did was so wrong. I felt underestimated and unappreciated. I knew that it was not okay for teachers to treat their students like that. No matter how hard I tried to prove them wrong, they never “saw” me let along appreciated my efforts. I was a child. I couldn’t tell my parents about this because my family had been through so much. This was one of the worst experiences I’ve ever had. Even until today, it still hurts me.

And I could say that I’m better with myself and I dont depend myself on other people for that source of happiness. It still gets hard occasionally but I try not to let the bad days win.

One time, I let my walls down and opened up to someone about it. Because I felt horrible about myself and I just didn’t want to get up, you know. So I told a few people about it. I trusted them enough to let them in and it turned out to be the worst thing I’ve done to myself. They turned their back on me when I became vulnerable to them.</p>
