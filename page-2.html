            It made me feel powerless.
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
            It made me feel angry but I couldn't express it to others.
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
            I felt terrible
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
            It made me feel really angry.
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;

            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
            Sad.
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
            Hurt.
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
            Made me feel unworthy and bitter.
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
            don't be a bully.
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
            The thing that gets me annoyed is when it isn't a fair scenario when multiple people are having a shot at one person.
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
            Bullying made me feel insecure, discouraged, scared.
            &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;
            I feel threatened.

  <p class="message">I didn't even know it was an act of bullying but all I know it was hurting me and shaped me into a vulnerable person and tbh at one point of my life, it also turned me into sort of a bully myself. The only logical reason for it is that I did it as a defence mechanism to protect me from getting hurt. I still feel bad even to this day I'm writing this and probably will always be.</p>

  <p class="message">I was bullied since 6th grade to junior high school; it made me felt insecure and degraded. There was even a point where it made me emotional and did violence due to my anger issues of being bullied. My friends hated me because I was a transferred student and thought I was acting 'cool' in purpose. Also, because the boys were hanging out with me (not amorous) yet they feel annoyed as they can not be that close to them. At these times, I go to school with my head down.</p>

  <p class="message">Back in elementary school, there were these teachers who treated me like I would never fit their expectations. Like all I did was so wrong. I felt underestimated and unappreciated. I knew that it was not okay for teachers to treat their students like that. No matter how hard I tried to prove them wrong, they never “saw” me let along appreciated my efforts. I was a child. I couldn’t tell my parents about this because my family had been through so much. This was one of the worst experiences I’ve ever had. Even until today, it still hurts me.

  <p class="message">They told me I only did it for attention but I only went to YOU. Of course I needed the attention. I needed help. I needed you. I just felt so helpless and unlovable for a long time. But after a while, I let time do its thing to heal. And I could say that I’m better with myself and I dont depend myself on other people for that source of happiness. It still gets hard occasionally but I try not to let the bad days win.

  <p class="message">I kind of stopped letting them control the way I live and embrace them. But sometimes they still creep up to me out of nowhere to this day. One time, I let my walls down and opened up to someone about it. Because I felt horrible about myself and I just didn’t want to get up, you know. So I told a few people about it. I trusted them enough to let them in and it turned out to be the worst thing I’ve done to myself. They turned their back on me when I became vulnerable to them.</p>

I am just a girl from Banjarmasin with a different skin colour from them. I’ve been called ugly, ‘pribumi’, weird, etc. At first I didn't really care, but as time goes by I started to think that what they said might be true. It really lowered my self esteem and it hurts.</p>

Unfortunately, some of the other children that they want to befriend with are superior. Eventually, instead of accepting him as their friend, they made him a clown. I feel bad for my mediocre fellow. Angry. but knowing that I didn't have enough power to stand with him, is the saddest of me</p>
